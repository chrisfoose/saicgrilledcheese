I made the repository drag and drop and am using that to complete this Grilled Cheese Project.

I have the pictures in a hard-coded random order.  It is possible for the end user to take the pictures and drag them below.  There is a checklist that can be manually checked.  The user can click clear to clear the checkboxes.
